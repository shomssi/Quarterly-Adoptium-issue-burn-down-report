# Adoptium Issue Burn-down Report

Create a single quarterly issue burn-down report covering the public repositories in the **adoptium** GitHub organization, posted as one GitHub issue in this repository.

## Scope

- Look across the public repositories in the `adoptium` organization, not just this one.
- Cover a custom date range (default: the last full calendar quarter relative to today). Count issues only — exclude pull requests.

## What to include

- For each repository: issues opened in the period, issues closed in the period, a burn-down score (`closed - opened`, where negative means the backlog is growing), and the count of stale open issues (no activity in the last 30 days).
- Up to 5 stale issues per repository, listed with title, link, and last-updated date, ordered most-stale first.
- An org-level list of the top 10 potentially under-served labels — labels where open issues outpace closed issues — with their open/closed counts.

## Process

1. Enumerate the public repositories in the `adoptium` organization.
2. For each repository, gather issues opened and closed during the reporting period, identify stale open issues, and tally label counts (open vs. closed) for issues opened in the period.
3. Rank repositories by stale issue count, descending.
4. Aggregate label stats across all repositories and rank by `open - closed`, descending, keeping the top 10.
5. Create a single GitHub issue in this repository containing the full report: period covered, per-repo summary (sorted by stale count), and the under-served labels list.

## Data handling (important — avoid large JSON payloads)

Previous runs failed with "Unable to process large JSON file for issues due to invalid structure" when fetching bulk issue data. To avoid this:

- Never fetch or write the full issue list of a repository (or the whole org) into a single file or a single API response. Work repo-by-repo, one small request at a time.
- Prefer the GitHub **search** API with date-range qualifiers and read `total_count` for tallies instead of downloading issue bodies. Examples:
  - opened in period: `repo:adoptium/<name> is:issue created:<start>..<end>`
  - closed in period: `repo:adoptium/<name> is:issue closed:<start>..<end>`
  - stale open: `repo:adoptium/<name> is:issue is:open updated:<=<30-days-ago>`
- For the up-to-5 stale issues per repo, request only what you need: search sorted by `updated` ascending with `per_page=5`, and select only the fields you use (title, url, updated date).
- For label stats, use search counts per label (`label:"<label>" created:<start>..<end>` with `is:open` / `is:closed`) on the most common labels, rather than aggregating from full issue dumps.
- Skip archived repositories and repositories with zero issue activity in the period as early as possible (a single count query) so you never fetch their data.
- Keep any intermediate files you write small (well under 1 MB) and validate JSON with `jq` before relying on it. If a response is truncated or fails to parse, retry that one small query — do not fall back to a bulk download.

## Constraints

- Read-only: do not close, comment on, or relabel any issue you analyze — this workflow only produces a report.
- Create exactly one issue.
- Skip any repository with zero issues in the period rather than listing it with empty stats.
